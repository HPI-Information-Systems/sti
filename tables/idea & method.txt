How do we interpret tables?

+ finding subject column

- read context of a table to know that is the table "about"
	* what is context
	* do we always have such context? 
	* is the relation between context and table explicit? (e.g., table caption mentions key concepts in table?)	

- look at actual rows of a table and guess what the table is about

(bad example: E:\Data\table annotation\tablesForAnnotation\wikiLinks\c4\r6\b\r\o\Broadcast_media_in_Kansas_City_783e.html_3
table context and content gives little information about subject)



+ once we know the subject column, start interpreting THAT column (iterative sampling approach?)
- what is it about (determing concept, and instance; granularity? football team v.s. organisation
- interpretation based on "less ambiguous" candidates to understand CONCEPT


+ once we know the concept, we find "entities"
- search entity belong to that concept; 


+ interpret columns
- assume columns are attributes of entities, search in KB
- if literal, leave it



+ if a column cannot be interpreted based on the subject column, interpret that column 
- find relation between two columns based on their concepts
