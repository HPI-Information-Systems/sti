# Semantic Table Interpretation

### DISCLAIMER

This project is based on the work described at [1]. The original code referred to in the paper is now hosted and can be downloaded from [here](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/Z.Zhang/resources/tableminerplus/sti_2015.zip). The code has then been significantly improved, undergone a lot of refactorization and re-implementation, and therefore, may not work with the cache included in the published data [here](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/Z.Zhang/resources/tableminerplus/data.tar.gz). 

This project provides implementation of several semantic table interpretation algorithms, including: [TO ADD]. **However, due to many things out of our control (e.g., use of in-house software in original works, different versions of knowledge bases), please note that we cannot guarantee identical replication of the original systems or reproduction of experiment results.**
