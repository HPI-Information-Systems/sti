# STI - please read!

This project is currently undergoing signficant re-factorization/implementation, and therefore, it is likely that this code will not work with the cached datasets (Freebase queries and results) published [here](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/Z.Zhang/resources/tableminerplus/data.tar.gz). If you wish to use the cached datasets, download a zip of [the previous system](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/Z.Zhang/resources/tableminerplus/sti_2015.zip).
